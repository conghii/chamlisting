[---TIÊU ĐỀ VÀ TEXT BÊN TRÁI---]
Bên trái khung hình: Text title "A DAILY DOSE OF POSITIVITY" (Pickle Green font, large, bold, inspiring).

[---SẢN PHẨM CHÍNH (BÊN PHẢI)---]
On a light oak desk, under soft natural sunlight:
(One clear plastic jar:1.3) with black lid, approx 3.3 inches tall, showing the "POSITIVE PICKLE" label.
(One beige gift box:1.2) standing next to it.

⚠️ CRITICAL HEIGHT CONSTRAINT: The jar and box MUST be EXACTLY THE SAME HEIGHT! 
Both products are approximately 3.3 inches tall. They should appear EQUAL in height when standing side by side.
Imagine placing a ruler across their tops - the line should be perfectly horizontal.
DO NOT make the box taller than the jar. They are IDENTICAL in height.
(Multiple green pickle-shaped cards) scattered naturally in front of the jar and box. Important Scale: The cards are small (approx 2 inches), looking tiny and cute next to the jar, showing the cartoon faces.

[---BỐI CẢNH BÌNH THƯỜNG (NON-HOLIDAY)---]
The set is placed on a clean, light oak wooden desk surface. The background is a gently blurred, sunlit cozy room shelf with a small green potted plant and a stack of books (creating a fresh, daily, uplifting vibe, no Christmas elements).

[---PHONG CÁCH & ÁNH SÁNG---]
High-end commercial product photography, vibrant and cheerful colors, (soft diffused natural sunlight:1.2) coming from the side creating a warm glow, clear visibility of all items and textures.

[---KỸ THUẬT---]

Title: "STEP 1. OPEN YOUR JAR".
Action: Close-up of hands twisting open the black lid of the clear "Positive Pickle" jar.
Setting: Sunlit kitchen counter with a small green plant.
[---PANEL 2 (GIỮA): BƯỚC 2 - RÚT THẺ---]
Title: "STEP 2. PICK A CARD".
Visual Correction (Sửa lỗi): A close-up macro shot of fingers pinching one small folded paper card (shaped like a pickle) from the jar.
Detail Focus: Show clearly that it is a paper product, not plastic. The card is currently closed (showing the cute pickle face on the outside).
Action: The hand lifts it delicately, like picking a lucky draw.
[---PANEL 3 (PHẢI): BƯỚC 3 (ĐÃ SỬA LẠI)---]
Title: "STEP 3. READ & SMILE".
Visual Correction: A close-up shot of a woman holding a single, tiny green pickle card between her thumb and index finger.
Important Scale: The card looks very small in her hand (approx 2 inches).
Key Detail (Mặt sau): The side facing the camera is the back of the card, showing white printed affirmation text (similar style to the reference image).
Emotion & Setting: The woman is smiling warmly down at the card. The open jar sits on a cozy coffee table nearby.
[---FOOTER---]
Bottom text box: "Daily happiness in 3 simple steps!"
[---PHONG CÁCH & KỸ THUẬT---] Commercial photography style, vibrant fresh colors (yellow, green, white), soft natural lighting, sharp focus on products, clean design, 8k resolution.

[---TIÊU ĐỀ & BỐ CỤC CHUNG---]
A clean, organized "What's Included" product photography shot (Knolling style).

⚠️ TEXT STYLE MANDATE (CRITICAL):
Top Banner: The text "**WHAT'S INCLUDED?**" MUST be in a **playful, bouncy, cartoon handwriting style**:
  - Font style: Rounded, irregular baseline (like Comic Sans meets hand lettering)
  - Color: Bright BLUE (#4A90E2) with slight white outline
  - Background: Soft yellow banner with wavy, hand-drawn edges (NOT straight geometric banner)
  - Feel: Fun, friendly, casual - NOT corporate or professional typography

DO NOT use standard printed fonts. This MUST look hand-drawn and playful.
The items are arranged neatly on a clean wooden surface, separated clearly to show quantity and scale.

[---PHONG CÁCH TEXT CHUNG CHO NHÃN---]
**CRITICAL TEXT STYLE:** All pointing labels and dimension text below are in a **friendly, rounded, hand-drawn marker font**. The text color is **Pickle Green**, sometimes inside chubby, hand-drawn speech bubbles or tag shapes with a **yellow or beige border** to match the product aesthetic.

[---CHI TIẾT SẢN PHẨM & NHÃN TEXT (ĐÃ STYLE HÓA)---]
1.  **THE JAR (Center):** The clear plastic jar (3.3 inches tall) filled with cards, black lid, yellow "Positive Pickle" label.

    * *Visual Detail:* Show clearly they are small (**approx 2 inches**) and some are slightly open to hint at the text inside.
    * *Text Label:* A playful bubble label reads: "**60x Unique Affirmation Cards**".
    * *Dimension Text:* Hand-drawn line next to a single card: "**2 inches (Tiny & Cute!)**".

4.  **THE NOTE (Bottom Corner):** The rectangular Thank You card.
    * *Text Label:* A playful bubble label reads: "**1x Thank You Card**".

[---BỐI CẢNH BÌNH THƯỜNG (EVERYDAY)---]
Placed on a light oak wooden desk. The background is a clean, bright white wall with soft shadows (Amazon commercial style), absolutely NO holiday/Christmas decorations. Just pure, fresh product focus.

[---PHONG CÁCH & KỸ THUẬT---]
High-end e-commerce photography, flat lay or slight 45-degree angle, sharp focus on all funny text labels, vibrant colors (Yellow, Green, Beige), 8k resolution.
`;

const SCENE_4_LISTING_REF = `
**CRITICAL SCALE CONSTRAINT:** The product is a **SMALL, PALM-SIZED JAR (3.3 inches)**. Do not render it as a large container. It should look compact and cute.

⚠️ COLLAGE DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
This is a 2x2 COLLAGE with 4 DIFFERENT scenes. Each panel MUST show a UNIQUE context.
DO NOT repeat the same image 4 times. Each panel requires distinct setting, people, and atmosphere.

[---KHUNG 1 (TOP LEFT): BẠN BÈ (FRIENDS IN CAFÉ)---]
* **Text Label:** A tag reading: "**Gift for Friends**"

* **Setting Details:** Half-empty coffee cups, café window with soft diffused daylight, other blurred diners in far background
* **NATURAL AUTHENTICITY:**
  - Genuine, mid-laugh expressions (not posed smiles)
  - Candid body language - leaning in, relaxed postures
  - Soft natural window light (NOT studio lighting)
  - Slightly imperfect composition - not centered, organic framing
  - Real café atmosphere - napkins, crumbs, lived-in feeling
* **Scale Check:** The box is small, fitting easily in one hand.

[---KHUNG 2 (TOP RIGHT): ĐỒNG NGHIỆP (OFFICE SETTING)---]
* **Text Label:** A tag reading: "**Gift for Colleagues**"
* **Visual:** A REAL, actively-used office desk. Not perfectly clean - lived-in workspace.
* **Action:** The small jar sits naturally among work items on the desk.
* **Setting Details:** Computer monitor (screen has content), half-drunk coffee in mug, sticky notes on monitor, papers with handwriting, pens scattered
* **NATURAL AUTHENTICITY:**
  - Realistic office lighting - fluorescent + window light mix
  - Desk has real clutter - keyboard, mouse, phone charger cable
  - Background slightly out of focus - colleague walking by (blurred)
  - Natural shadows from desk lamp and window
  - Jar placed casually, not perfectly centered
* **Scale Check:** The jar is VERY SMALL - about half the height of the coffee mug.

[---KHUNG 3 (BOTTOM LEFT): HỌC SINH (STUDY DESK)---]
* **Text Label:** A tag reading: "**Gift for Students**"
* **Visual:** An AUTHENTIC student desk mid-study session. Realistically messy.
* **Action:** The tiny jar tucked among study materials, one green pickle card leaning against it.
* **Setting Details:** Open textbook (pages visible), notebook with actual handwritten notes/doodles, laptop keyboard partially visible, highlighters uncapped, coffee stain on paper
* **NATURAL AUTHENTICITY:**
  - Warm desk lamp creates golden pool of light
  - Natural shadows from stacked books
  - Realistic study clutter - eraser shavings, crumpled sticky notes
  - Late evening atmosphere - dim room, focused light on desk
  - Hand resting on desk edge (partial, suggesting someone studying)
* **Scale Check:** Jar is TINY - smaller than the textbook spine, dwarfed by stacked books.

[---KHUNG 4 (BOTTOM RIGHT): BẢN THÂN (SELF-CARE MOMENT)---]
* **Text Label:** A tag reading: "**Gift for Yourself**"
* **Visual:** An INTIMATE, peaceful self-care moment. Person curled up on couch.
* **Action:** Person holding a tiny green card close, reading it with genuine soft smile. Natural, unposed moment.
* **Setting Details:** Chunky knit blanket draped naturally (wrinkles, folds), jar on wooden side table with tea mug, soft couch pillows
* **NATURAL AUTHENTICITY:**
  - Soft afternoon window light (NOT studio light)
  - Natural face - minimal/no makeup, relaxed expression
  - Cozy clothes - oversized sweater, fuzzy socks visible
  - Background softly blurred - hint of living room (plant, bookshelf)
  - Steam rising from tea mug for lived-in feeling
  - Card held naturally between fingers (not perfectly displayed)
* **Scale Check:** The card is VERY SMALL in hand (business card size). Jar on table looks tiny and unobtrusive.

[---PHONG CÁCH & KỸ THUẬT---]
**Style:** AUTHENTIC Lifestyle Photography - MUST look real, candid, lived-in.
**Quality:** 8k, sharp focus on products, SLIGHT imperfections OK (adds realism).
**Lighting:** 100% NATURAL light sources (windows, desk lamps, café lighting). NO studio softboxes.
**Composition:** Slightly off-center, organic framing. NOT perfectly symmetrical.
**Atmosphere:** Each panel must feel like a real moment caught on camera, NOT a staged photoshoot.

Row 1: "No Box / Simple Plastic Bag" | Red X
